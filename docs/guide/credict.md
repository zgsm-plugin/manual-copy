# Getting Credits

First, please determine if your login account is linked to GitHub or a phone number. If you are unsure which account you are using, you can visit the **User Info & Credit Usage** page to verify. This page also displays your remaining credit balance.
If you log in with a phone number, we recommend linking your GitHub account on this page to easily receive credit rewards from future GitHub-related promotions.
