# Get credits

First, determine if you are logged in with a GitHub account or a phone number. If you are unsure which account you're using, you can visit the **User Info & Credit Usage** page. This page also shows your remaining Credit balance.

If you logged in with a phone number, we recommend binding your GitHub account on this page. This will make it easy to receive Credit rewards from future GitHub-related promotional activities.
